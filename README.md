# prog-tutorial
small programming tutorial

## how to start

* fork this project
* clone this repository in your machine
* add one file in the presentation/ directory with your (nick)name and some description about yourself, motivation, etc. You can use text plain (.txt) or markdown (.md) and please include some e-mail for contact if needed.
* add, commit, push and submit as pull request ( this will not be public - unless you want )

## costs

It is for free. But my free time is limited so if I don't know you, you should talk to me first instead just send pull requests - I will ignore if needed.

## tracks

I imagine few tracks in this tutorial, split in several lessons. My first target will be go ( starting from basic, of course ).

## suggestions

You can use the tab "Issues" to give me feedbacks, suggestions or requests. Please be nice.
